- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Gayanthi Gunawardhana 
- ðŸ‘€ I'm a Technology transactions and data privacy lawyer. I advice tech companies during the deployment and the various stages of development of technology by reviewing and drafting tech development and transfer contracts, which typically involve IP and privacy concerns. I've been interested in the legal implications of disruptive technologies since I specialized in FinTech law for my LL.M. My research interests are ethics of AI and technology. Particularly algorithmic accountability.
